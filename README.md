# ShoppingCartEngine
This repository contains the code for building a simple business engine for shopping cart to apply different rules depending on user purchase. I have taken a TDD approach to build
the solution. The code is built in an inceremental fashion where the basic code layout was created and then how to align the code to SOLID principles has been displayed.
The solution is easily maintanable and scalable.
